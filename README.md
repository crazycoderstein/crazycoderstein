## About me

I'm a fullstack developer working in Web3. :rocket:

I previously was working full-time as a core contributor to the [Aave Protocol][0], mainly on the UI. 👻

I am also currently contributing to a few other projects, including one I have co-founded, the [Arbor Protocol][2]. 🌳

I am also gaining knowledge and experience in smart contract auditing by working as an auditor with [Secure3][9].

I really enjoy working on open-source projects and within the Ethereum community.

Hey, I've even implemented the dark mode on [Vitalik's blog][6] - just check out this [Tweet][1] and the PRs [one][7] & [two][8]! 💪

Outside of DeFi, I'm really interested in a couple areas:
- Music NFTs: Building out the Arbor Protocol, a generative music-making NFT platform with royalties 🎼
- ZKPs: Researching and working with zero-knowledge technologies. I have recently graduated from [Zero-Knowlege University][3]. 🔐

And when I'm not writing code, I write and produce music in my spare time, creating sounds like [this][4] and [this][5]. 🎵
